The last link is sulfuric acid which is the only acid I don't have a pure version of rn.
I'd use my own if I had some.
If the ph of the tank is low I can add sodium carbonate until it's good. That's the ingredient in ph up.
If the ph is low we can return the ph down without opening it. 12 has been very uncomfortable looking lately
and I wouldn't be surprised if it was because of an unbalanced ph. Since I haven't been adding easy balance (don't have any)
and because of all the recent water changes, the ph is almost certainly outta wack
Thanks again, you're the best ‚ù§
